	<h1>OPENING DOORS</h1>
	<h3>Imagine two virtual rooms separated by a set of doors.  In one room, businesses are searching for capital to finance and grow their operations. In the other room, investors are searching for opportunities to make their hard earned money work and produce net returns without fees.
	<br/><br/> 
	We at Murabaha Club create and nurture this relationship. We push those doors open and get both sides to trade with each other. Our intelligent online platform helps to facilitate these partnerships and provide click button access to the world of capital and investment returns.</h3>

	<h2>Do it Ethically.</h2>
	<h3>But it's not what we do. It's how we do it that really makes the difference. How we conduct ourselves in business is what defines us. We believe in relevant pricing, fair trade, honesty interactions and integrity in operating a business. We do not believe money is a product to be traded. We believe that for a loan to happen, a fair commercial trade needs to occur. We facilitate this trade seamlessly with a click of a button will allow you the borrower to receive capital with a fixed cost without any fears on hikes in interest rates. Investors, receive the best returns agreed in advance without having any fees deducted. And we never, ever fund unethical businesses and activities.</h3>
