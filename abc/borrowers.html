		<h2>Murabaha Loan Program</h2>
		<span class="close-button"><b>X</b></span>
		<h3>The right financing can come from a number of places. The good news is that we can help with everything from short term working capital to medium term purpose finance</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b><u>Secured Business Loans (SBL):</u></b></li>
			<li><b>Favorable terms and cheaper rates make secured loans a popular borrowing option for businesses.</b></li>
			<li>It's easy to understand why secured business loans (SBL) have traditionally been the choice of many borrowers. Our SBLs are simple to set up. Include long repayment term options. And can be very cost effective.  Remember, we don't charge interest, just low-cost fees that never change. So, if you're seeking a more conventional, more stable route to finance then this could be the answer. Secured loans can be as flexible as you need them to be. They're perfectly suited to fund start-ups, acquisitions, and expansion. Our secured Business Loans are available up to &pound;5 million and can be used alongside various other funding options.</li>
			<li><b><u>Unsecured business loans:</u></b></li>
			<li><b>Let's get the best 'unsecured' loan deal secured for your business</b></li>
			<li>Unsecured loans are often accessed by businesses in a hurry. They offer the 'fast-track to finance'.</li>
			<li>Depending on your situation, you can get your hands on between &pound;25,000 and &pound;150,000 in just 3 days. The money can be used as working capital to cover your business running costs. Maybe you have a large marketing bill. Or need to purchase new equipment urgently. Or have a short-term cash flow problem and need cash fast to cover the payroll. Many businesses use their unsecured loan like they would a credit card. A pre agreed amount of funding is made available, and you can then draw down multiple, revolving amounts of money as and when you need it. We don't ask you to put up any capital as security or do we incorporate 'use of proceeds' requirements. Instead we look at how credit worthy your business is and set our fees accordingly. The better your credit history, the better deal we can offer you. What's more, our platform makes it very simple for you to collate a vast range of credit information and financial evidence to strengthen your case and lower the cost.
			</li>
			<li><b>Asset backed Financing</b></li>
			<li><b>Lease the asset. Release the potential.</b></li>
			<li>We are here to support and nurture business growth. One way we can help is by Asset backed financing. You sell your assets to our investors who then immediately lease them back to you, thus releasing capital that would have otherwise been tied up. You can then get that money working for you to finance expansion plans, or to fund a new venture. And at the end of the lease period, you regain ownership of the asset.
			</li>
			<li><b>Working Capital Financing</b></li>
			<li><b>Get your cash working for you, not your suppliers.</b></li>
			<li>For many businesses, supplier costs are the biggest drain on resources, creating cash flow problems and stifling growth.
			</li>
			<li>With a Working Capital Financing agreement, the borrower can commission our investors â€“ or lenders - to purchase supplies on their behalf, up to 100% of the invoice value. The borrower then buys the supplies from our investors at a price that includes the original invoice, plus an agreed fee for the lender.</li>
			<li>The financing is based on set, pre agreed low-cost fees and payments are deferred and spread over the term of the financing agreement putting the borrower back in control of cash flow.</li>
			<li>Working Capital Financing enables businesses to project their finances more accurately and utilise capital more effectively to fund growth.</li>

				<h3>Buy to let mortgages</h3>
				<b>Buy to let mortgages that let you buy quickly, and more cost effectively</b>
				<span>
					A landlord's live can be pretty hectic at times. You've usually got enough on your plate dealing with rental agents, tenants and building maintenance teams without worrying month by month about your buy to let mortgage shooting through the roof because of interest rate hikes. So, the good news is that at the Murabaha Club we don't charge interest. Instead we agree a set fee, and we pin that fee to the floor. Throughout the life of your loan that fee will never raise. Not one penny. We've made our loans easy to manage and even easier to set up. You can apply for a buy-to-let mortgage between &pound;70,000 - &pound;500,000 in minutes and get the funds within three days, providing:
				</span>
				<ol>
					<li><var></var>You're a UK resident aged 18yrs or over</li>
					<li><var></var>Your personal income is at least &pound;30,000 per annum</li>
					<li><var></var>You are NOT a first time buyer</li>
					<li><var></var>The loan is not for a new build</li>
					<li><var></var>You are not purchasing off-plan or investing in commercial property</li>
					<li><var></var>The value of the property you wish to purchase exceeds &pound;100,000</li>
					<li><var></var>You can provide proof that you are an experienced landlord</li>
					<li><var></var>The rental coverage of the property will exceed 125% of the required loan repayment</li>
					<li><var></var>You pass all legal UK credit, anti-fraud and anti-money laundering checks</li>
					<li><var></var>The property is based in England or Wales</li>

				<h3>Commercial property mortgages</h3>
				<b>This is a fantastic commercial opportunity for property investors. Will you seize your Murabaha moment?</b>
				<span>
					In business, there is no time like the present. When you have identified an exciting opportunity to invest in commercial property, you want to seal the deal as soon as possible. And that's where we'll play a crucial part in your success. We make the application process as painless as possible. No red-tape delays. No red-faced investors waiting for decisions, either. Funds are generally transferred into the borrowe's bank within just two weeks. And when you consider that we offer loans from &pound;100,000 right up to &pound;5million, those turnaround times are pretty impressive.
					<br/>
					And we're flexible, too. You can borrow up to 75% of the commercial value of the property, over anything from just one month to three years.
