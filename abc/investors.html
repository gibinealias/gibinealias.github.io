	<h3>Question:</h3>
	<h3>Are you happy investing with faceless, impersonal organizations that seem devoid of all accountability? Are you content having little or no say as to where your money is invested?
	<br/>
	And do you accept that sometimes your money could be used in ways that may not sit comfortably with your own ideas of what's ethical and what isn't?</h3>
	<br/>
	<p>Or do you choose our way?
	<br/>
	We're different because we offer you the chance to make a difference. The chance to help local businesses expand, diversify and thrive. The chance to follow their progress. To see their ideas working. To buy into their vision and share in their success. This is your Murabaha moment. Will you seize it?</p>
