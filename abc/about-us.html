		We believe Money is a means to an end.
		<br/>
		We discovered that some ends required a new kind of financing.
		<br/>
		It didn't exist, so we created it.
		<br/>
		We did it so businesses and investors can feel rewarded morally and  financially.
		<br/>
		We are Murabaha Club
		<br/>
	</span>
	<h3>This is where borrowers and investors come together to benefit from each other. Where rewarding partnerships are forged, based on honesty and integrity. Where ethical investors can make a difference as well as a profit. Where enterpreneurs can quickly and easily acquire the capital they need to fund growth. This is the Murabaha Club. And this is your Murabaha moment.</h3>
	<br/>
	<p>The financial 'establishment' has grown out of touch with investors and borrowers. We need to change things. Create new opportunities. It's time to deliver control back into the hands of investors and borrowers and introduce a stronger sense of relevance, fairness and transparency - both in the pricing of loans for borrowers, and in the return for investors.</p>

			<h3>We do it differently</h3>
			<h4>As a peer-to-peer financial service, we're shaking everything up.
			<br/>
			We're going above and beyond what is considered best practice, so there's relevance in pricing, fairness in credit grading and transparency that all parties can see, validate and approve. We deliver a holistic and sophisticated approach to finance and investment never seen before. 
			</h4>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>We do it smartly</h3>
			<h4>We employ top-end technology to facilitate all transactions seamlessly. With a click of a button, borrowers can receive capital with fixed costs and without any fears of dreaded hikes in interest rates. While investors can agree the best terms with borrowers, without having any fees or charges nibbling away at their returns.</h4>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>But most importantly, we do it ethically</h3>
			<h4>How we conduct ourselves in business is what defines us. Despite our systematic, diagnostic approach to investment, we are not just ruled by a shrewd business head; we are also ruled by our heart and by what we believe to be right and proper. We believe that investments should be rewarding, both financially and morally.
			<br/>
			We believe in relevant pricing, fair trade, honest interactions and integrity in every aspect of our business. We do not believe money is a product to be traded. We believe that for a loan to happen, a fair commercial trade needs to occur.
